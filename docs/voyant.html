    <h1>The other title that I worked with was Despicable Me.</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>The first common word I noticed after analyzing the text, especially after utilizing Voyant, was the main character's name: "Gru."</li>
            <li>What I have noticed between both texts are that they are focused on their respective main characters "Gru" and "Megamind" within the scrpit.</li>
                <li>The word "minion" also appears very frequently between each of the movie's scripts.</li>
